## About First

![A placeholder image: for a portrait photo or artwork.](img/about-portrait.jpg)

Hi, I’m First Surname. Over the last two decades, my design practice has focused on designing and building beautiful, accessible web experiences, and on helping organizations create more effective design systems

My design practice focuses on responsive, device-agnostic interfaces; on building resilient, accessible products; and on creating digital design systems at scale. Over the last two decades I’ve worked with organizations large and small, helping teams untangle even the thorniest challenges of working on the modern web.

In other words, I enjoy working on difficult design problems alongside good, thoughtful people. Got a project you’d like to work on together? Let’s chat. `me@email.cz`
