Hi, my name is Šárka Bucharová, i am 21. I am Graphic designer, digital painter, painter, web designer, 3D maker and just for fun photographer..

I focuse on branding that I prefer because I like the creativity throughout the project from A - Z. Among other things i would call myself more like a mix designer. I jump through techniques depenting in my mood. 

At my free time you can meet me in the gallery, but also at rave or gym. I have been doing martial sports since childhood. I like the fact that after training you put on your make-up and leave looking like a lady. I also love cooking so there's no way of being hungry at my home.

 Got a project you’d like to work on together? Let’s chat. `marketing@2mservis.com`
