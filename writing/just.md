# “PROMISE”

by Šárka Bucharová

What does it actually mean, and what can we imagine? We meet promises from the early stages of our childhood. Usually, it begins within our family relationships. Parents promise us love, care, and a sense of security as they take care of us. We start to making connections with friends. Promise the support or friendship will last forever.

The only promises that tend to are those from our parents, or at least, that's how it should be. Its sad, it's not always the case. Not everyone is fortunate enough to experience this. As a kids we cant hold the weight of words. So it failed usually to keep the promises. Friendships endings because of the changes in our personalities during growing up.

There are promises that we may struggle with. Some things we cant control and things around may prevent us from keeping our promises. Like saying "drive safe" or "take care of yourself." Yes, I promise. Promises guarantee us emotional fulfillment. A request that we often don't understand the weight of words.

Promises have started move into our professional lives. Companies, employers, or even we ourselves make guarantees to our clients. Distrust among people has shifted us into a nation of paper. We need everything to be sign it. These are the only promises that hold because we still don't know the true weight of these words.
