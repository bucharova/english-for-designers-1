# Promise.
 

What does it actually mean, and what can we imagine?
We meet promises from the early stages of our childhood. Usually, it begins within our family relationships. Parents promise us love, care, and a sense of security as they take care of us. As we start making connections with friends, promises of support or friendship will last forever.

The only promises that tend to are those from our parents, or at least, that's how it should be. Its sad, it's not always the case. Not everyone is fortunate enough to experience this. As a kids, we might not hold the weight of words. So its often failing to keep promises, leading friendships to fade away over time due to the changes in our personalities during growing up.

There are promises that we may struggle with. Some things we cant control, and things around may prevent us from keeping our promises, like saying "drive safe" or "take care of yourself." Yes, I promise. Promises emotionally guarantee the fulfillment of a request that we often don't understand the weight of words.

Promises have started move into our professional lives. Companies, employers, or even we ourselves make guarantees to our clients. Distrust among people has shifted us into a nation of paper, where everything needs to be documented. These are the only promises that hold because we probably still don't know the true weight of these words.
