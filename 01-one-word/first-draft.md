## First Draft
# Promise. 

What does it actually mean, and what can we imagine?
We meet promises from the early stages of our childhood. Typically, it begins within our family relationships. Parents promise us love, care, and a sense of security as they take care of us. As we start making connections with friends, promises of mutual support or that our friendship will last forever.

The only promises that tend to endure over time are those from our parents, or at least, that's how it should be, though sadly, it's not always the case. Not everyone is fortunate enough to experience this. As children, we might not hold the weight of words as strongly, often failing to keep promises, leading friendships to fade away over time due to the changes in our personalities during growing up.

There are promises that we may struggle with. Some things are beyond our control, and things around may prevent us from keeping our promises, like saying "drive carefully" or "take care of yourself." Yes, I promise. Promises emotionally guarantee the fulfillment of a request, yet we often don't fully understand the weight of words.

Promises have started to transition into our professional lives, where companies, employers, or even we ourselves make guarantees to our clients. Distrust among people has shifted us into a nation of paper, where everything needs to be documented. These are the only promises that hold because we probably still don't know the true weight of these words.
